I am a __Web developer__ and an experienced __Quality Assurance Tester__ with a __B.tech in Computer Science__ and __B.Ed. in Education__. Since May 2016 I have been part of a 12 week intensive Web-Development coding bootcamp to improve my technical knowledge and get more hands on experience with Real-world Projects.

I have insatiable appetite for knowledge and am seeking a company where I can contribute hands on experience to crafting clean and reusable code as a Junior Web Developer.
